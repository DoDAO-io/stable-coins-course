 **Why Stablecoins**        

One of the most promising benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to provide a global financial  system that can settle payments within seconds. A strong and stable global currency is an essential part  of a healthy financial system, and over the past few years we've seen many innovative projects come up with  ideas for creating tokens that are equivalent to USD or other currencies on the blockchain. Some of these projects  have failed, but a few have survived and proven to be very resilient.

Stablecoins are seen as a useful tool for a number of reasons: There are a few key reasons why stablecoins are seen as a useful tool:
- **Improving cross-border transactions**: Stablecoins can help facilitate low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border transactions while reducing complexity compared to traditional methods.
- **Entry Point**: Newcomers to the crypto world often want a stable way to store their money, similar to what  they're used to with banks. Stablecoins offer a more predictable and stable path for these people.

 Stablecoins offer a more stable and predicable path to the new comers.  

- **Base Currency** : We are all used to calculating all the stocks, transactions, spends in a base currency that remains pretty stable with time and makes it easier to compare value of one thing with another.

- **Better risk management** : Stablecoins can provide an alternative to traditional investments  and can be used to hedge against market volatility.
