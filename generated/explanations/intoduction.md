 **Why Stablecoins**        
## What are Stablecoins
Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency, commodity, or other cryptocurrency. The value of a stablecoin is designed to remain stable, unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which can experience significant price fluctuations. Examples of stablecoins include Tether, USD Coin, Dai etc. These coins can be used for various applications such as trading, payments and remittances.

## Why Stablecoins?
One of the most promising benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to provide a global financial  system that can settle payments within seconds. A strong and stable global currency is an essential part  of a healthy financial system, and over the past few years we've seen many innovative projects come up with  ideas for creating tokens that are equivalent to USD or other currencies on the blockchain. Some of these projects  have failed, but a few have survived and proven to be very resilient.


There are a few key reasons why stablecoins are seen as a useful tool:
- **Improving cross-border transactions**: Stablecoins can help facilitate low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border transactions while reducing complexity compared to traditional methods.
- **Entry Point**: Newcomers to the crypto world often want a stable way to store their money, similar to what  they're used to with banks. Stablecoins offer a more predictable and stable path for these people.
- **Base Currency** : A stablecoins value does not fluctuate as much as other cryptocurrencies, making it a more reliable currency to calculate stocks, transactions, and spends with. This also makes it easier to compare the value of one thing to another.
- **Increased adoption** : The volatility of other cryptocurrencies can make them difficult to use for everyday transactions or as a means of payment. Stablecoins can make it easier for businesses and individuals to use and accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which leads to an increase in adoption.
- **Better risk management** : Stablecoins can provide an alternative to traditional investments  and can be used to hedge against market volatility.
- **Decentralized Finance**: Stablecoins can be used as collateral, borrowing and lending in decentralized  finance platforms which can provide more opportunities for financial inclusion and better returns compared  to traditional finance.

## Types of Stablecoins
In the last few years, many stablecoin projects have been created, each with a different approach to representing the USD on blockchain. Let's first look at the most prominent categories of stablecoins and then understand the advantages and drawbacks of each of these categories.

### Fiat Backed
Fiat-backed stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the US dollar. In this system, each USD-pegged token is backed 1:1 by actual US dollars. This means that fiat-backed stablecoins must be backed by bank accounts that contain USD or other stable currency. As a result, the old financial system's centralized structure and regulated institutions are used by fiat-backed stablecoin issuers.

Since there are no clear regulations governing the production of stablecoins, financial institutions have no specific standards to follow. This lack of transparency can be a major problem for stablecoin issuers, as it leaves them open to exploitative practices.

Stablecoin issuers earn revenue from investing the cash they receive from customers, and use this money to cover their operational expenses. Any money left over after paying for operations is generally profit for the issuer. However, in some cases issuers may choose to invest this money in long-term or risky ventures in order to maximize their profits. This can lead to losses of funds for customers.

**It's important for users to understand how stablecoins are backed. What percentage of the backing is in cash, and what percentage is in investments? What types of investments are made by the issuer?**

### Crypto Backed

### Commodity Backed

### Algorithmic

## Why so many types?
Newcomers entering the crypto might be perplexed as to why there are so many type of stable coins as ultimately the do the same thing that is represent a stable currency like USD on blockchain.
