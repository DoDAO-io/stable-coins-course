##### What is the function of veFXS in the Frax ecosystem?  

- [ ]  It allows FXS holders to lock up their tokens for a certain period of time in order to generate voting escrow FXS and earn bonuses, governance rights, and AMO profits
- [ ]  It allows FXS holders to participate in Frax gauges and influence or direct FXS to different FRAX gauges
- [ ]  It allows FXS holders to earn bonuses for recollateralizing the Frax Protocol
- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The veFXS feature allows FXS holders to lock up their tokens for a certain period of time in order to generate voting escrow FXS and earn bonuses, governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller) profits. The longer the FXS tokens are locked, the more bonuses awarded to the veFXS holders. Additionally, veFXS holders are able to participate in Frax gauges and influence or direct FXS to different FRAX gauges, a similar mechanism established by the Curve protocol and its gauge system.

##### How does the Frax Protocol handle situations where additional collateral is needed?  

- [x]  a) By using a recollateralization mechanism to add collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%
- [ ]  b) By using a buyback mechanism
- [ ]  c) By increasing the collateralization ratio
- [ ]  d) By decreasing the collateralization ratio
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The Frax Protocol has built-in mechanisms, known as recollateralization and buybacks, to handle situations where additional collateral is needed or excess collateral is present. When the total collateral value in USD falls below the desired collateral ratio, recollateralization allows users to add collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%. This incentivizes arbitragers to close the gap and restore the collateral ratio for FRAX.

##### How does the Frax Protocol handle situations when there is more collateral than needed to maintain the collateral ratio?  

- [ ]  a) By using a recollateralization mechanism to add collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%
- [x]  b) By using a buyback mechanism to remove excess collateral
- [ ]  c) By increasing the collateralization ratio
- [ ]  d) By decreasing the collateralization ratio
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Buybacks occur when there is more collateral than needed to maintain the collateral ratio. In this case, FXS holders can use FXS tokens to "buy back" the excess collateral, which is then burned by the platform. This converts the excess value into FXS tokens, maintaining the target collateral ratio. However, it's important to note that there is no bonus rate for the buyback function.

##### How does the Frax ecosystem incentivize long-term participation from community members?  

- [ ]  Through the emission of FXS tokens
- [ ]  Through the vote of FXS stakers
- [ ]  Through the "Gauge Rewards System"
- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The veFXS feature allows FXS holders to lock up their tokens for a certain period of time in order to generate voting escrow FXS and earn bonuses, governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller) profits. The longer the FXS tokens are locked, the more bonuses awarded to the veFXS holders. Additionally, veFXS holders are able to participate in Frax gauges and influence or direct FXS to different FRAX gauges.
