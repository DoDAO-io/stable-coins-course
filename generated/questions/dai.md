No critical security issues were discovered. The audit specifically identified known vulnerabilities of ERC-20 tokens, the ability for the contract owner to block transferring, a missing event in ERC20 compliance, and the need to check input addresses for empty values. Overall, the audited smart contract was determined to be safe to deploy, with only low severity issues found during the audit.
