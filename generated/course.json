          "details": "## What are Stablecoins\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency, commodity, or other cryptocurrency. The value of a stablecoin is designed to remain stable, unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which can experience significant price fluctuations. Examples of stablecoins include Tether, USD Coin, Dai etc. These coins can be used for various applications such as trading, payments and remittances.\n\n## Why Stablecoins?\nOne of the most promising benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to provide a global financial  system that can settle payments within seconds. A strong and stable global currency is an essential part  of a healthy financial system, and over the past few years we've seen many innovative projects come up with  ideas for creating tokens that are equivalent to USD or other currencies on the blockchain. Some of these projects  have failed, but a few have survived and proven to be very resilient.\n\n\nThere are a few key reasons why stablecoins are seen as a useful tool:\n- **Improving cross-border transactions**: Stablecoins can help facilitate low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border transactions while reducing complexity compared to traditional methods.\n- **Entry Point**: Newcomers to the crypto world often want a stable way to store their money, similar to what  they're used to with banks. Stablecoins offer a more predictable and stable path for these people.\n- **Base Currency** : A stablecoins value does not fluctuate as much as other cryptocurrencies, making it a more reliable currency to calculate stocks, transactions, and spends with. This also makes it easier to compare the value of one thing to another.\n- **Increased adoption** : The volatility of other cryptocurrencies can make them difficult to use for everyday transactions or as a means of payment. Stablecoins can make it easier for businesses and individuals to use and accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which leads to an increase in adoption.\n- **Better risk management** : Stablecoins can provide an alternative to traditional investments  and can be used to hedge against market volatility.\n- **Decentralized Finance**: Stablecoins can be used as collateral, borrowing and lending in decentralized  finance platforms which can provide more opportunities for financial inclusion and better returns compared  to traditional finance."

          "shortTitle": "Types",
          "details": "## Types of Stablecoins\nIn the last few years, many stablecoin projects have been created, each with a different approach to representing the USD on blockchain. Let's first look at the most prominent categories of stablecoins and then understand the advantages and drawbacks of each of these categories.\n\n### Fiat Backed\nFiat-backed stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the US dollar. In this system, each USD-pegged token is backed 1:1 by actual US dollars. This means that fiat-backed stablecoins must be backed by bank accounts that contain USD or other stable currency. As a result, the old financial system's centralized structure and regulated institutions are used by fiat-backed stablecoin issuers.\n\nSince there are no clear regulations governing the production of stablecoins, financial institutions have no specific standards to follow. This lack of transparency can be a major problem for stablecoin issuers, as it leaves them open to exploitative practices.\n\nStablecoin issuers earn revenue from investing the cash they receive from customers, and use this money to cover their operational expenses. Any money left over after paying for operations is generally profit for the issuer. However, in some cases issuers may choose to invest this money in long-term or risky ventures in order to maximize their profits. This can lead to losses of funds for customers.\n\n**It's important for users to understand how stablecoins are backed. What percentage of the backing is in cash, and what percentage is in investments? What types of investments are made by the issuer?**\n\n### Crypto Backed\nCryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are a type of digital asset that is backed by other digital assets like BTC, ETH, or other tokens. In order to mint new stablecoins, digital assets are locked up as collateral in smart contracts. DAI from MakerDAO is a well-known example of a stablecoin that is backed by cryptocurrency.\n\nSince crypto prices can be volatile, stablecoins are overcollateralized to ensure that the price stays as stable as possible. This means that a stablecoin with a crypto asset backing of $1 might have an underlying asset worth at least $2. If crypto prices fall, more crypto must be used to back the stablecoin; otherwise, the stablecoins' value would decrease.\n\nThere can still be cases where the value of crypto falls and the collateral value becomes lower than the optimal ratio. In these cases, platforms liquidate the position of the borrower (the person who deposits collateral to mint new stablecoins). Different platforms take different approaches to liquidation, some selling the collateral at a fixed discount, and some using American or Dutch options. The amount of collateral to be liquidated also varies from one platform to another.\n\n### Commodity Backed\nCommodity-backed stablecoins are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins in that they are backed by physical commodities such as gold, silver, or oil. Even real estate can be used as collateral for commodity-backed stablecoins. The coins may or may not be redeemable for the physical asset. In a sense, commodity-backed stablecoins are a digital representation of a valuable real-world asset.\n\nFor those who find it difficult to invest in literal precious commodities, commodity-backed stablecoins can be a useful alternative. These coins are backed by commodities like gold, which gives them the same value as the collateral. They can be liquidated when desired, and because they're not as volatile as fiat or cryptocurrencies, they can be a safer investment.\n\n### Algorithmic\nThe \"two-coin\" system is a typical algorithmic stablecoin structure in which one coin is used to \"absorb\" market volatility, and the other strives to keep the peg. \n\nLets assume there are two tokens `A_USD`, and `ALGO`. `A_USD` value remains $1 and `ALGO` is balancer token which is sold or bought to maintain the peg of  `A_USD` at $1\n\nWhen the `A_USD` supply is too small and demand for it is too high, the price of `A_USD` goes above $1. To bring `A_USD` back to its peg, the protocol lets users trade 1 `A_USD` of `ALGO` for 1 `A_USD`. This trade burns 1 USD of `ALGO` and mints 1 `A_USD`, which users can sell for 1.01 USD and pocket a profit of 1 cent. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but these profits add up when done in large quantities.\n\nWhen the supply is too large and demand is too low, the opposite happens: The price of `A_USD` goes below $1. So the protocol lets users do the opposite as above: Users can buy 1 `A_USD` for 0.99 USD, then trade 1 `A_USD` for 1 USD of `ALGO`. The trade burns 1 `A_USD` and mints 1 USD of `ALGO`, netting the arbitrage trader a profit of .01 `A_USD`.\n\nThis is how the price of `A_USD` is maintained at $1 USD"

          "details": "A stablecoin must maintain a delicate balance between three major objectives: price stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency. \n\n![Trilemma](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/stable-coins-course/main/images/Trilemma.png)\n\n**Price Stability** - Price stability is one of the most important aspects for stablecoins. Fiat-based coins offer the highest price stability, followed by crypto-backed coins and then algorithmic stablecoins. In 2022, we saw the failure of the biggest algorithmic coin, UST.\n\n**Importance of Decentralization** - Decentralization is important because it allows for more democratic practices around the world. When governments have too much control, they can block users' funds which can cripple a person's ability to speak out or protest against the government. A fully decentralized world would benefit greatly from these democratic practices, and we should strive to not give up on these principles. Even though fiat backed stable coins have excellent price stability, they lack decentralization as they are issued by a centralized issuer.\n\n**Capital Efficiency** -  Capital efficiency defined as how much capital is required to make $1 of a token. In case of algorithmic coins we might not need any real assets, so it has very high capital efficiency. In case of fiat backed stable coins we need 1 USD cash(something similar) to create $1 token.  In case of collateralized crypto coins, this value can be as high as 3-4 times i.e. we might need $3-$4 worth of crypto assets as collateral to generate $1 worth of stablecoin token."

          "details": "At the end of 2022, transactions that only involve the top four largest stablecoins by market capitalization (USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI) make up 76% of all trading volume across centralized exchanges, according to CryptoCompare. Fiat-backed stablecoins make up 91.7% of this crypto sector, and Tether (USDT) and USDCoin (USDC) comprise the majority of that, leaving crypto-backed and algorithmic stablecoins to make up the remainder.\n\nStablecoins have a lot of potential uses that could be really beneficial for mainstream commercial purposes, like merchant payments and cross-border remittances. In fact, we're starting to see more stablecoin payments being sent all over the world via public blockchain networks - which suggests that these assets are not just a store of value for crypto market players, but actually represent an improvement over traditional payment methods. So it's likely that demand for stablecoins will continue to grow in the long term. \n\nThat's one of the reasons why we're seeing more DeFi protocols launching their own platform-native stablecoins - as a way to source liquidity and offer integrated services.\n\nFor example, the team behind automated market maker Curve has released plans on Github for a new stablecoin design called a Lending-Liquidating AMM Algorithm or LLAMMA. With this design, the collateral type is contingent on price performance. Decentralized lender Aave has also released a technical paper for its upcoming overcollateralized GHO stablecoin. This could help it lower capital efficiency costs."

          "details": "USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US dollar. It was created in 2018 by Circle and Coinbase through a partnership called the CENTRE consortium. USDC is an ERC-20 token, which means it is built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows a set of standardized protocols. It allows users to send US dollars over the internet and on public blockchains, giving them greater accessibility and faster transfer speeds. In addition, USDC can be easily converted back to US dollars at any time.\n\n\nCircle is a Boston-based financial services company that was founded in 2013. It offers a variety of products and services, including a peer-to-peer payment platform, a cryptocurrency exchange, and a trading platform for institutional investors. In addition to creating USDC, Circle has also played a significant role in the development of the stablecoin market.\n\n\nCoinbase is a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange that was founded in 2012. It is one of the largest and most well-known exchanges in the world, and it offers a range of products and services for both individual and institutional investors.\n\n\nUSDC was developed to address two main issues with other cryptocurrencies: volatility and the difficulty of converting between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To maintain stability and transparency, USDC is fully backed by US dollars held in reserve, and the CENTRE consortium publishes regular reports on the total supply of USDC and the amount of backing it has. In addition, members of the consortium must meet certain standards, including licensing, compliance, technology, and accounting, in order to issue USDC.\n"

          "details": "### Mint and Burn\n\n\nBusinesses can open a Circle Account to trade US dollars for USDC. When a company deposits USD into their Circle Account, Circle credits the company with the corresponding amount of USDC. \"Minting\" is the process of creating a new USDC. This operation generates new USDC for circulation.\n\n\nSimilarly, if a company wants to trade its USDC for US dollars, they can deposit USDC into their Circle Account and request to receive US dollars for free. \"Burning\" is the process of redeeming USDC. This procedure removes USDC from circulation.\n\n\nWhen US dollars are exchanged for USDC on a digital asset exchange, the exchange will normally supply the balance of USDC on hand to complete the trade. If the exchange needs additional USDC to complete the deal, it will frequently use its Circle Account to create extra USDC.\n\n\n### Transparency\n\n\nSince its launch in 2018, Circle has published monthly reserve reports for USDC that are attested to by Grant Thornton, a global accounting firm. These reports provide independent confirmation that Circle holds at least as much in dollar-denominated reserves as the amount of USDC in circulation. In addition to the standard information provided in these reports, Circle also recently began publishing details about the CUSIPs, maturity dates, and market values of the T-bills in its portfolio, as well as the financial institutions that hold the cash portion of the USDC reserve and the weighted average maturity of the entire reserve. Starting in July 2022, Grant Thornton's attestations will cover all of this additional information, providing independent confirmation of the detailed composition and sufficiency of the USDC reserve. An attestation from an accounting firm is similar to an audit in that it provides assurance around specific statements or criteria. In this case, the firm reviews the supporting documentation prepared by Circle's management and verifies the criteria presented in the reserve report. Circle also files annual audited financial statements with the SEC that cover the USDC reserve. In order to prepare the reserve report, Circle must reconcile the differences between the real-time movement of USDC on the blockchain and the settlement delays and business hours of traditional financial institutions. These differences are accounted for in the attested reserve asset balances and do not impact the overall size of the reserve or the fact that USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. Circle's commitment to providing transparent and timely reporting on its risk minimization and liquidity maintenance efforts helps to give the market confidence in USDC. It plans to continue enhancing its transparency as policy and regulatory requirements evolve and better reporting opportunities arise.\n\n\n### Backing\n\n\nUSDC is fully backed by the equivalent value of U.S. dollar-denominated assets and is held in the management and custody of leading U.S. financial institutions, including BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon. The USDC reserve consists of cash and short-dated U.S. government obligations, specifically U.S. Treasuries with maturities of three months or less. As of May 13, 2022, the USDC reserve was worth $50.6 billion and consisted of $11.6 billion in cash (22.9%) and $39.0 billion in U.S. Treasuries (77.1%). As of Jan 5, 2023 the total USDC in circulation is $44 B. The total circulating supply is also equal to $44 billion.\n\n\nUSDC is always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. Customers of Circle can mint or redeem USDC in exchange for U.S. dollars through their Circle account, with the exchange happening nearly instantly subject to the settlement of funds. Individual retail users can also exchange USDC for U.S. dollars globally through leading digital asset exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. As of May 13, 2022, Circle had minted 99.3 billion USDC and redeemed 61.1 billion USDC during the year. There are thousands of projects and exchanges supporting USDC in over 190 countries, facilitating its use and exchange for market participants. On Jan 5, 2023, the 24-hour trading volume of USDC was $ 4 billion.\n",

          "details": "### History\n\n\nUSDT (Tether) is a stablecoin, which means it is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset, such as the US dollar, and is designed to maintain a stable value. It was first issued in 2014 by Tether Limited, a company founded by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars. Originally called Realcoin, the stablecoin did not gain much popularity. In 2015, Tether was acquired by new owners based in Hong Kong, who also owned the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. The integration of Tether into the Bitfinex ecosystem led to an increase in its popularity.\n\n\nHowever, Tether's Taiwanese banking partners grew concerned about the lack of know-your-customer (KYC) checks and other safeguards as the stablecoin circulated on various blockchains. They ended their relationship with Tether in 2017, which jeopardized Tether's ability to facilitate the conversion of fiat currency to cryptocurrency and vice versa. Tether was able to secure new banking partners in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, and during the subsequent cryptocurrency bull market, Tether's stablecoins (others being EURT, CNHT, MXNT, XAUT) became widely used, with its flagship USDT token ranking among the top tokens by traded volume and market capitalization.\n\n\nTether was originally built on the Bitcoin network, but has since expanded to other leading blockchains. It is registered in the British Virgin Islands and lists JL van der Velde as its CEO. Tether and Bitfinex are both owned by iFinex.\n\n\n### Mint and Burn\n\n\nTether Limited issues USDT by \"minting\" new tokens and adding them to circulation. This is done through a process called \"issuance,\" which involves Tether Limited sending the stablecoin to exchanges or other approved parties in exchange for an equal value of the stable asset (e.g., US dollars). Tether Limited can also \"burn\" USDT by removing them from circulation. This is typically done when the company receives the stablecoin back from exchanges or other approved parties in exchange for the stable asset.\n\n\n\n### How They are Backed\n\n\nUSDT is meant to be backed 1:1 by the stable asset, meaning that for every USDT in circulation, Tether Limited is supposed to hold an equivalent value of the stable asset in reserve. According to Tether Limited, the stable asset backing USDT is typically held in the form of US Treasury bills, which are low-risk, short-term debt securities issued by the US government. However, as mentioned above, the company has not undergone a full audit to prove that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation.\n\n\n### Transparency and Issues\n\n\nTether Limited has faced criticism over its lack of transparency, as the company has not undergone a full audit to prove that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation. In 2017, Tether Limited hired accounting firm Friedman LLP to conduct an audit, but the audit was never completed and the relationship between the two companies ended in January 2018. \n\n\nTether has been publishing quarterly audit [reports](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports) since 2021 with the help of firms such as Moore, Mha Cayman and BDO. However, most of the companies feel that those are just attestation which don't give the full picture.\n\n\nTether Limited and its affiliated exchange, Bitfinex, have faced several controversies over the years. One of the main controversies is the allegation of price manipulation. In April 2017, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued subpoenas to Tether Limited and Bitfinex as part of an investigation into potential market manipulation. In 2018, researchers Griffin and Shams published a study suggesting that Bitcoin prices increased after Tether minted new USDT during market downturns, potentially as an attempt at market manipulation. However, this conclusion was disputed by Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange that is affiliated with Tether, and subsequent researchers have found little to no evidence that Tether's issuance of USDT influenced Bitcoin prices.\n\n\nAnother controversy surrounding Tether is its lack of transparency and audits. Tether claims that its USDT stablecoin is backed 1:1 by US dollars held in reserve, but the company has not undergone a full audit to prove this. In 2018, the New York Attorney General's office filed a lawsuit against Tether and Bitfinex, alleging that the companies had engaged in a cover-up to hide the loss of $850 million in client and corporate funds. The case is ongoing.\n\n\nTether and Bitfinex have also faced security and liquidity issues. In August 2016, Bitfinex was hacked and lost approximately 120,000 bitcoins, worth over $70 million at the time. In November 2017, $31 million worth of USDT was stolen from the company. Tether has also struggled to meet withdrawal requests in the past and has not produced an audit showing that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation.\n\n\nIn September 2022, Bitfinex and Tether (referred to in court records as B/T) were ordered by the New York District Court to produce documents showing the backing of USDT, the outcome of which is still pending. The court also ordered B/T to stop loaning out Tether's stablecoins and to provide a full accounting of the Tether reserve. You can read more about it [here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-judge-orders-tether-to-document-usdt-backing).\n\n\n### Growth and adoption\n\n\nDespite the controversies surrounding Tether Limited and Bitfinex, USDT has become one of the most widely used stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market. It is accepted on a wide range of exchanges and is often used as a \"bridge currency\" to facilitate trades between different cryptocurrencies. This widespread adoption has helped to make USDT a key player in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\nThe adoption of USDT has grown rapidly since its inception, with its market capitalization increasing from around [$10 million in 2015 to over $83 billion as of 2022](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/). As more people become familiar with the benefits of stablecoins, and as the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to mature, it is likely that the use and adoption of USDT will continue to grow.\n\n\nAt present, Tether (USDT) is the dominant stablecoin, with a [circulating supply of around $66 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/). Its closest competitor is Circle's USDC, which has a circulation of approximately $44 billion. In terms of market value, Bitcoin and Ether are the only cryptocurrencies that surpass USDT. Investors have the option of using stablecoins as a means of easily entering the cryptocurrency market, or as a tool for trading between different tokens. The stability in their value makes transactions more streamlined, and since USDT is more widely available than other stablecoins, it offers more options for converting it into other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nThe significance of USDT lies in its wide accessibility and versatility. It can be exchanged for over 4,000 other currencies on centralized exchanges and potentially even more on decentralized exchanges that don't always accept regular dollars. This makes it almost impossible for traders to actively participate in the crypto market without encountering USDT at some point. Should there be any issues that compromise the appeal or usage of USDT, it could trigger a ripple effect across the entire industry and significantly decrease trading volumes.\n\n\n### Good and Bad News\n\n\nHowever, the lack of transparency and audits has also led to concerns about the stability of USDT and the potential for fraud or mismanagement. Until Tether Limited undergoes a full audit and proves that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation, these concerns are likely to continue.\n\n\n### References\n\n\n  - `https://tether.to/en/`\n  - `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)`\n  - `https://cointelegraph.com/news/research-tether-bitfinex-manipulation-reason-behind-2017-bitcoin-price-highs`\n  - `https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoins-2017-rise-was-market-manipulation-tether-study/`\n  - `https://www.reuters.com/technology/tether-bitfinex-agree-pay-425-mln-fines-settle-us-cftc-charges-2021-10-15/`\n  - `https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/`\n"

          "key": "dai-introduction",
          "details": "### About\n\n\nDAI is a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a value of one US dollar. It was created by the MakerDAO project, which was launched in 2017 by Rune Christensen, the CEO of MakerDAO. MakerDAO is an open-source project that is maintained by a team of developers and a community of volunteers.\n\n\nDAI is unique in that it is a decentralized stablecoin, which means that it is not issued or controlled by any central authority. Instead, it is generated and managed by a network of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized nature of DAI allows it to be free from the influence of governments or financial institutions and makes it more resistant to censorship or interference.\n\n\nDAI is used in various ways, including as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a collateral asset. It has gained widespread adoption in the cryptocurrency community and has been used in a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\n\n### Minting and Burning DAI\n\n\nDai is generated when users deposit collateral assets into [Maker Vaults](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#maker-vaults) (Maker Vaults facilitate the generation of Dai against locked-up collateral. Users open Vaults via the Oasis Borrow dashboard or one of many other user interfaces that allow the management of Vault operations ) within the Maker Protocol. This process allows users to access liquidity and enters Dai into circulation. Others can obtain Dai by purchasing it from brokers or exchanges, or by receiving it as payment.\n\n\nOnce generated, purchased, or received, Dai can be used in the same way as other cryptocurrencies. It can be sent to others, used as payment for goods and services, and even saved through a feature of the Maker Protocol called the [Dai Savings Rate (DSR)](https://ethereumprice.org/guides/article/dai-savings-rate-explained/).\n\n\nIf a user who has borrowed DAI against collateral decides to pay back the loan, the DAI coins are \"burned\" and the collateral deposit in the account is available for withdrawal. The process of minting and burning DAI helps to maintain its value at or near one US dollar.\n\n\nThe [MCD_DAI_JOIN](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/dai/dai-token/dai-token.md#mint-and-burn) adapter contract in the Maker Protocol is authorized to call the mint and burn functions of the DAI token in order to increase or decrease the total supply of DAI. These functions are also used when users deposit or withdraw DAI from the Dai Savings Rate contract.\n\n\n### Transparency and Audits\n\n\nMakerDAO and the DAI stablecoin are designed to be transparent and auditable. The smart contracts that govern the Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) and the minting and burning of DAI are open-source, which allows anyone to review the code and understand how the system works.\n\n\nIn addition, MakerDAO has undergone several independent audits by reputable firms, which have found that the system is secure and functioning as intended. In 2019, Callisto Network Security conducted a security audit of the Dai Token (DAI) smart contract which identified four issues, including three of low severity and one of owner privileges (which could potentially be risky for investors). No critical security issues were discovered. The audit specifically identified known vulnerabilities of ERC-20 tokens, the ability for the contract owner to block transferring, a missing event in ERC20 compliance, and the need to check input addresses for empty values. Overall, the audited smart contract was determined to be safe to deploy, with only low severity issues found during the audit. [Here](https://callisto.network/dai-token-dai-security-audit/) is the complete report.\n\n\n### Backing of DAI\n\n\nAll DAI is backed by surplus collateral that has been escrowed in audited and publicly viewable Ethereum smart contracts. This means that anyone with an internet connection can monitor the health of the system at any time by visiting [daistats.com](https://daistats.com/). Since, data related to DAI backing is available onchain, it can be queried by anyone. Also there are a number of graphing application that show the runtime information of the system.\n\n\nThe value of the collateral used to mint DAI must always exceed the value of the DAI itself, a process known as overcollaterization. This is to ensure that the collateral can cover the value of the DAI in the event that the market value of the collateral falls. If the value of the collateral falls below the value of the DAI, the vault account may be liquidated, with a ratio of 1.5 collateral to 1 DAI.\n\n\nTo ensure that undercollateralized accounts have sufficient funds to be liquidated, the MakerDAO system offers \"keeper\" accounts. Keepers are special user accounts that stake their cryptocurrency holdings to provide liquidity to pay off the collateral of vault accounts that lose value over time. This helps to maintain a steady supply of DAI in circulation to match the value of one US dollar.\n\n\n### Maintaining Peg and Liquidation\n\n\nMaintaining the peg of Dai is crucial to ensuring its stability and value as a stablecoin. One important aspect of this is the Liquidations system within the Maker Protocol. This system ensures that there is always enough collateral backing the Dai generated in Maker Vaults, and that collateral is auctioned off in a timely and efficient manner if it falls below its designated Liquidation Ratio (LR).\n\n\n[Keepers](https://blog.makerdao.com/introduction-to-auctions-and-keepers-in-mcd/), who are independent actors typically automated bots, participate in these collateral auctions by bidding. The winning bidder receives the collateral, while a 13% liquidation penalty is added to the debt and levied on Vault owners. Any funds remaining are returned to the Vault owner.\n\n\nEfficient and effective liquidation mechanisms are vital to maintain Dai stability and confidence in the currency. Collateral auctions must be carried out in a timely manner and in a liquid market environment. The Maker Protocol Liquidations System and Oasis.app provide users with vital information for all collateral assets available in the Maker Protocol.\n\n\nRecently, Liquidations 1.2 was introduced to address the problem of extreme price volatility and a limited number of Keepers. This solution limits the number of auctions that can occur simultaneously and the total value of collateral being auctioned at any one time. This allows Keepers to recycle capital through exchanges and bid on multiple auctions, providing some protection for Vault owners in the event of a flash crash.\n\n\nEfforts are also underway to finalize Liquidations 2.0, which aims to further improve the liquidation ecosystem by increasing the number of Keepers, providing a more efficient liquidation process, and improving the overall quality of the Keeper software. These efforts will help ensure that Dai remains stable and maintain confidence in the currency for both Vault owners and users.\n\n\n### Issues and Hacks\n\n\nLike any complex system, MakerDAO and DAI have experienced some issues and challenges. \n\n\n[On March 12th and 13th, 2020](https://medium.com/@whiterabbit_hq/black-thursday-for-makerdao-8-32-million-was-liquidated-for-0-dai-36b83cac56b6), the MakerDAO Protocol experienced a significant loss of 5.67 million DAI due to liquidations on the platform. This event, known as Black Thursday, was caused by a combination of factors including the drop in Ether price, blockchain congestion, and manipulation by liquidators.\n\n\nThe high gas prices associated with the congestion on the blockchain caused a delay in the update of the MakerDAO oracles, which provide the market price of Ether. This created an opportunity for liquidators to exploit the situation by bidding low amounts of DAI in liquidation auctions, as there were no other competitors at the time. This tactic led to massive profits for a small group of liquidators, but resulted in significant losses for Vault owners and the MakerDAO system as a whole.\n\n\nIn response to the crisis, the MakerDAO community came together to discuss and implement solutions. Instead of shutting down the system, the decision was made to launch a Debt Auction, where users can buy freshly minted MKRs (the governance token of MakerDAO) for DAI. The goal is to dilute the token share of current MKR holders and help eliminate the system debt. Additionally, new system parameters were selected to make it more difficult for fraudulent manipulations in the future. These include increasing the maximum lot size from 50 to 500 ETH and extending the duration of auction rounds.\n\n\nThe Black Thursday event exposed vulnerabilities in the MakerDAO Protocol and highlighted the need for continued monitoring and improvements to the system. The community is actively working to address these issues and prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. However, it's worth mentioning that security is always a trade-off and a zero-risk system is not possible.\n\n\n### Good and Bad News\n\n\nDAI has generally been well-received and has gained widespread adoption as a stablecoin. It has been used in various applications, including as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a collateral asset.\n\n\nHowever, there are also some concerns about the backing of DAI and the potential for market manipulation. Some critics have argued that the reliance on Ethereum as collateral makes DAI vulnerable to fluctuations in the value of Ethereum.\n\n\n[Recently](https://cointelegraph.com/news/makerdao-should-seriously-consider-depegging-dai-from-usd-founder), MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen has suggested that the organization should \"seriously consider\" depegging its stablecoin, DAI, from the US dollar following recent sanctions on cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash and the freezing of USDC addresses by Circle. Christensen raised concerns over DAI's heavy reliance on a centralized asset, USDC, which represents over 50% of MakerDAO's DAI collateralization, according to Dai Stats. The stablecoin is currently the fourth largest USD-pegged stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with a market cap of $7 billion. The idea of converting all USDC from MakerDAO's peg stability module into ether was met with criticism, with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calling it a \"risky and terrible idea.\"\n\n\nDespite these concerns, DAI has proven to be a reliable and stable stablecoin, and its use is likely to continue to grow in the future.\n\n\n### References\n\n\n  - `https://originstamp.com/blog/what-is-dai-coin-and-why-is-it-special/`\n  - `https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/`\n  - `https://blog.makerdao.com/the-maker-protocols-liquidations-system-upgrade-1-2-is-live/`\n  - `https://blog.makerdao.com/the-market-collapse-of-march-12-2020-how-it-impacted-makerdao/`\n"

          "key": "frax-introduction",
          "shortTitle": "Introduction",
          "details": "### Introduction\nMany people are hesitant to adopt purely algorithmic coins because so many of them have failed over time. For example, UST was the biggest stable coin but it got depegged in 2022 and lost all its value. The main problem with algorithmic designs is that they often have a hard time getting started, they grow slowly, and they can be very volatile, which makes people lose faith in their ability to be stablecoins.\n\nThe Frax protocol is a two-token system comprising a stablecoin, Frax (FRAX), and a governance token, Frax Shares (FXS). The protocol also has a pool contract which holds USDC collateral. Pools can be added or removed with governance. Frax is a hibrid of algorithmic and collateral based stablecoins.\n\nFractional Reserve Asset Exchange (FRAX) stablecoins can be minted by placing the appropriate amount of its constituent parts into the system. At genesis, FRAX is 100% collateralized, meaning that minting FRAX only requires placing collateral into the minting contract. During the fractional phase, minting FRAX requires placing the appropriate ratio of collateral and burning the ratio of Frax Shares (FXS).\n\nThe Frax Protocol is designed to accept any type of cryptocurrency as collateral, but this implementation will mainly use on-chain stablecoins to help reduce volatility. This will make it easier for FRAX to transition to more algorithmic ratios smoothly. As the system's velocity increases, it will become safer to include volatile cryptocurrency, such as ETH and wrapped BTC, into future pools with governance.\n\nAlthough there's no predetermined timeframes for how quickly the amount of collateralization changes, we believe that as FRAX adoption increases, users will be more comfortable with a higher percentage of FRAX supply being stabilized algorithmically rather than with collateral. \n\nThe collateral ratio refresh function in the protocol can be called by any user once per hour. If the price of FRAX is above or below $1, the function can change the collateral ratio in steps of .25%. When FRAX is above $1, the function lowers the collateral ratio by one step and when the price of FRAX is below $1, the function increases the collateral ratio by one step. Both refresh rate and step parameters can be adjusted through governance.\n\n### Recollateralization and Buybacks\n\n\nThe Frax Protocol has built-in mechanisms, known as recollateralization and buybacks, to handle situations where additional collateral is needed or excess collateral is present. When the total collateral value in USD falls below the desired collateral ratio, recollateralization allows users to add collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%. This incentivizes arbitragers to close the gap and restore the collateral ratio for FRAX. On the other hand, buybacks occur when there is more collateral than needed to maintain the collateral ratio. In this case, FXS holders can use FXS tokens to \"buy back\" the excess collateral, which is then burned by the platform. This converts the excess value into FXS tokens, maintaining the target collateral ratio. However, it's important to note that there is no bonus rate for the buyback function.\n\n\n### Transparency and Audits\n\n\nFRAX is committed to transparency and has undergone several independent audits to ensure the security and stability of its platform. The team regularly publishes audit reports and technical details about the platform's underlying smart contracts on its GitHub page, allowing users and researchers to review and verify the platform's code. [Here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits) is the complete list of audits.\n\n\n### Performance Upgrades: veFXS and FRAX v2 AMOs\n\n\nThe Frax protocol has introduced several performance upgrades to its system, including the veFXS and Frax v2 AMOs. The veFXS feature allows FXS holders to lock up their tokens for a certain period of time in order to generate voting escrow FXS and earn bonuses, governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller) profits. The longer the FXS tokens are locked, the more bonuses awarded to the veFXS holders. Additionally, veFXS holders are able to participate in Frax gauges and influence or direct FXS to different FRAX gauges, a similar mechanism established by the Curve protocol and its gauge system.\n\n\nRecently, [Convex has partnered with the Frax protocol](https://convexfinance.medium.com/december-update-protocol-expansion-cvx-eth-incentive-migration-2c9327b48259#0a3b) to further align the two protocols' incentive programs, specifically around locking veFXS into the CVX protocol. Convex was launched in [May 2021](https://convexfinance.medium.com/convex-finance-pre-launch-announcement-3630b2a428d0) as a platform intended to boost CRV rewards and simplify staking CRV for liquidity providers and stakers by creating an access point to CRV benefits through its native CVX token. As a result, Convex began actively collecting CRV and veCRV tokens as soon as it was introduced. By early summer 2021, it had become the largest holder of veCRV tokens in the [Curve Wars](https://medium.com/bityard/the-curve-wars-explained-2c4e9594617). Curve Finance compensates liquidity providers with CRV tokens, granting governance rights over which protocols' pools are supported through CRV awards and fee sharing.Thus, Frax holds [≈21%](https://daocvx.com/) of CVX giving them substantial governance power in the Convex protocol, which can be thought of as a proxy for veCRV governance power and directing future CRV rewards.\n\n\nFurthermore, Frax has launched the algorithmic market operations modules, or AMOs, which creates smoother operations for Frax by automating the movement of FRAX and its collateral across the DeFi ecosystem. The Frax AMOs further enable FRAX growth by leveraging Frax’s assets in a capital efficient way.\n\n\n### Growth and Adoption\n\n\nOne piece of good news for FRAX is the platform's growing user base and trading volume, which have steadily increased since its launch. The market cap reached $130M within a month of launch, and later on reached its peak at $2.9B. As of 14th Jan, 2023 the market cap is at $1.02B. FRAX has also received positive attention from the DeFi community and has partnered with several well-known projects in the space, including Chainlink and Compound.\n\n\nThe Frax protocol offers a new and improved solution for stablecoins by utilizing Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology. By combining the use of FRAX stablecoins and FXS governance tokens, the protocol ensures trustless stability, decentralization and scalability in the face of market instability. Unlike other stablecoins such as Tether or DAI, FRAX eliminates the risk of over-collateralization and sudden market fluctuations.\n\n\nAs the market adapts to the growing demands and challenges, the adoption of crypto and stablecoins continues to rise. Among the latest innovations in the crypto space, FRAX is leading the way with its unique fractional-algorithmic approach to stability.

          "details": "The price stability of stable coins is an important factor to consider, as we have seen that many algorithmic coins are not able to maintain a stable peg and have resulted in failure. The hybrid model of FRAX uses the same technique for minting and burning stable coins, but here the collateral is also added or redeemed to the system and not just the absorption token (FSX).\n\nAt all times in order to mint new FRAX a user must place $1 worth of value into the system\n\n![Mint and Redeem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/stable-coins-course/main/images/mint_redeem.png)\n`Source: https://docs.frax.finance/`\n\n### When FRAX price moves above $1\n\nAnyone can mint new tokens by depositing $1 worth of value into the system. The value can be in the form of either FXS or collateral. When FRAX is in the 100% collateral phase, all of the value that is used to mint new tokens must be in collateral. As the protocol transition into the fractional state, some of the value that enters into the system during minting becomes FXS (which is then burned). For example, in a 96% collateral ratio, every FRAX minted requires $.96 of collateral and burning $.04 worth of FXS. In a 95% collateral ratio, every FRAX minted requires $.95 of collateral and burning $.05 of FXS, and so on.\n\nIf the price of FRAX jumps to 1.01, people who get involved in these arbitrage opportunities, can make a profit of 1 cent for every dollar minted\n\n### When FRAX price moves blow $1\nIf the market price of FRAX falls below $1, FRAX tokens can be bought cheaply on the open market and redeemed for $1 of value from the system. This creates an arbitrage opportunity. At all times, users are able to redeem FRAX for $1 worth of value from the system. The only difference is what proportion of the collateral and FXS is returned to the redeemer. When FRAX is in the 100% collateral phase, 100% of the value returned from redeeming FRAX is collateral.\n\nAs the protocol moves into the fractional phase, part of the value that leaves the system during redemption becomes FXS (which is minted to give to the redeeming user). For example, in a 98% collateral ratio, every FRAX can be redeemed for $.98 of collateral and $.02 of minted FXS. In a 97% collateral ratio, every FRAX can be redeemed for $.97 of collateral and $.03 of minted FXS.",

When the total collateral value in USD falls below the desired collateral ratio, recollateralization allows users to add collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%. This incentivizes arbitragers to close the gap and restore the collateral ratio for FRAX.",

In this case, FXS holders can use FXS tokens to \"buy back\" the excess collateral, which is then burned by the platform. This converts the excess value into FXS tokens, maintaining the target collateral ratio. However, it's important to note that there is no bonus rate for the buyback function.",
