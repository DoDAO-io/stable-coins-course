          "details": "### About\n\nUSD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US dollar. It was created in 2018 by Circle and Coinbase through a partnership called the CENTRE consortium. USDC is an ERC-20 token, which means it is built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows a set of standardized protocols. It allows users to send US dollars over the internet and on public blockchains, giving them greater accessibility and faster transfer speeds. In addition, USDC can be easily converted back to US dollars at any time.\n\n\nCircle is a Boston-based financial services company that was founded in 2013. It offers a variety of products and services, including a peer-to-peer payment platform, a cryptocurrency exchange, and a trading platform for institutional investors. In addition to creating USDC, Circle has also played a significant role in the development of the stablecoin market.\n\n\nCoinbase is a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange that was founded in 2012. It is one of the largest and most well-known exchanges in the world, and it offers a range of products and services for both individual and institutional investors.\n\n\nUSDC was developed to address two main issues with other cryptocurrencies: volatility and the difficulty of converting between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To maintain stability and transparency, USDC is fully backed by US dollars held in reserve, and the CENTRE consortium publishes regular reports on the total supply of USDC and the amount of backing it has. In addition, members of the consortium must meet certain standards, including licensing, compliance, technology, and accounting, in order to issue USDC.\n\n\n### Mint and Burn\n\n\nBusinesses can open a Circle Account to trade US dollars for USDC. When a company deposits USD into their Circle Account, Circle credits the company with the corresponding amount of USDC. \"Minting\" is the process of creating a new USDC. This operation generates new USDC for circulation.\n\n\nSimilarly, if a company wants to trade its USDC for US dollars, they can deposit USDC into their Circle Account and request to receive US dollars for free. \"Burning\" is the process of redeeming USDC. This procedure removes USDC from circulation.\n\n\nWhen US dollars are exchanged for USDC on a digital asset exchange, the exchange will normally supply the balance of USDC on hand to complete the trade. If the exchange needs additional USDC to complete the deal, it will frequently use its Circle Account to create extra USDC.\n\n\n### Transparency\n\n\nSince its launch in 2018, Circle has published monthly reserve reports for USDC that are attested to by Grant Thornton, a global accounting firm. These reports provide independent confirmation that Circle holds at least as much in dollar-denominated reserves as the amount of USDC in circulation. In addition to the standard information provided in these reports, Circle also recently began publishing details about the CUSIPs, maturity dates, and market values of the T-bills in its portfolio, as well as the financial institutions that hold the cash portion of the USDC reserve and the weighted average maturity of the entire reserve. Starting in July 2022, Grant Thornton's attestations will cover all of this additional information, providing independent confirmation of the detailed composition and sufficiency of the USDC reserve. An attestation from an accounting firm is similar to an audit in that it provides assurance around specific statements or criteria. In this case, the firm reviews the supporting documentation prepared by Circle's management and verifies the criteria presented in the reserve report. Circle also files annual audited financial statements with the SEC that cover the USDC reserve. In order to prepare the reserve report, Circle must reconcile the differences between the real-time movement of USDC on the blockchain and the settlement delays and business hours of traditional financial institutions. These differences are accounted for in the attested reserve asset balances and do not impact the overall size of the reserve or the fact that USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. Circle's commitment to providing transparent and timely reporting on its risk minimization and liquidity maintenance efforts helps to give the market confidence in USDC. It plans to continue enhancing its transparency as policy and regulatory requirements evolve and better reporting opportunities arise.\n\n\n### Backing\n\n\nUSDC is fully backed by the equivalent value of U.S. dollar-denominated assets and is held in the management and custody of leading U.S. financial institutions, including BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon. The USDC reserve consists of cash and short-dated U.S. government obligations, specifically U.S. Treasuries with maturities of three months or less. As of May 13, 2022, the USDC reserve was worth $50.6 billion and consisted of $11.6 billion in cash (22.9%) and $39.0 billion in U.S. Treasuries (77.1%). As of Jan 5, 2023 the total USDC in circulation is $44 B. The total circulating supply is also equal to $44 billion.\n\n\nUSDC is always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. Customers of Circle can mint or redeem USDC in exchange for U.S. dollars through their Circle account, with the exchange happening nearly instantly subject to the settlement of funds. Individual retail users can also exchange USDC for U.S. dollars globally through leading digital asset exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. As of May 13, 2022, Circle had minted 99.3 billion USDC and redeemed 61.1 billion USDC during the year. There are thousands of projects and exchanges supporting USDC in over 190 countries, facilitating its use and exchange for market participants. On Jan 5, 2023, the 24-hour trading volume of USDC was $ 4 billion.\n"

          "details": "### History\n\n\nUSDT (Tether) is a stablecoin, which means it is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset, such as the US dollar, and is designed to maintain a stable value. It was first issued in 2014 by Tether Limited, a company founded by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars. Originally called Realcoin, the stablecoin did not gain much popularity. In 2015, Tether was acquired by new owners based in Hong Kong, who also owned the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. The integration of Tether into the Bitfinex ecosystem led to an increase in its popularity.\n\n\nHowever, Tether's Taiwanese banking partners grew concerned about the lack of know-your-customer (KYC) checks and other safeguards as the stablecoin circulated on various blockchains. They ended their relationship with Tether in 2017, which jeopardized Tether's ability to facilitate the conversion of fiat currency to cryptocurrency and vice versa. Tether was able to secure new banking partners in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, and during the subsequent cryptocurrency bull market, Tether's stablecoins (others being EURT, CNHT, MXNT, XAUT) became widely used, with its flagship USDT token ranking among the top tokens by traded volume and market capitalization.\n\n\nTether was originally built on the Bitcoin network, but has since expanded to other leading blockchains. It is registered in the British Virgin Islands and lists JL van der Velde as its CEO. Tether and Bitfinex are both owned by iFinex.\n\n\n### Mint and Burn\n\n\nTether Limited issues USDT by \"minting\" new tokens and adding them to circulation. This is done through a process called \"issuance,\" which involves Tether Limited sending the stablecoin to exchanges or other approved parties in exchange for an equal value of the stable asset (e.g., US dollars). Tether Limited can also \"burn\" USDT by removing them from circulation. This is typically done when the company receives the stablecoin back from exchanges or other approved parties in exchange for the stable asset.\n\n\n### Transparency and Audits\n\n\nTether Limited has faced criticism over its lack of transparency, as the company has not undergone a full audit to prove that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation. In 2017, Tether Limited hired accounting firm Friedman LLP to conduct an audit, but the audit was never completed and the relationship between the two companies ended in January 2018. \n\n\nTether has been publishing quarterly audit [reports](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports) since 2021 with the help of firms such as Moore, Mha Cayman and BDO. However, most of the companies feel that those are just attestation which don't give the full picture.\n\n\n### How They are Backed\n\n\nUSDT is meant to be backed 1:1 by the stable asset, meaning that for every USDT in circulation, Tether Limited is supposed to hold an equivalent value of the stable asset in reserve. According to Tether Limited, the stable asset backing USDT is typically held in the form of US Treasury bills, which are low-risk, short-term debt securities issued by the US government. However, as mentioned above, the company has not undergone a full audit to prove that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation.\n\n\n### Issues and Hacks\n\n\nTether Limited and its affiliated exchange, Bitfinex, have faced several controversies over the years. One of the main controversies is the allegation of price manipulation. In April 2017, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued subpoenas to Tether Limited and Bitfinex as part of an investigation into potential market manipulation. In 2018, researchers Griffin and Shams published a study suggesting that Bitcoin prices increased after Tether minted new USDT during market downturns, potentially as an attempt at market manipulation. However, this conclusion was disputed by Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange that is affiliated with Tether, and subsequent researchers have found little to no evidence that Tether's issuance of USDT influenced Bitcoin prices.\n\n\nAnother controversy surrounding Tether is its lack of transparency and audits. Tether claims that its USDT stablecoin is backed 1:1 by US dollars held in reserve, but the company has not undergone a full audit to prove this. In 2018, the New York Attorney General's office filed a lawsuit against Tether and Bitfinex, alleging that the companies had engaged in a cover-up to hide the loss of $850 million in client and corporate funds. The case is ongoing.\n\n\nTether and Bitfinex have also faced security and liquidity issues. In August 2016, Bitfinex was hacked and lost approximately 120,000 bitcoins, worth over $70 million at the time. In November 2017, $31 million worth of USDT was stolen from the company. Tether has also struggled to meet withdrawal requests in the past and has not produced an audit showing that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation.\n\n\nIn September 2022, Bitfinex and Tether (referred to in court records as B/T) were ordered by the New York District Court to produce documents showing the backing of USDT, the outcome of which is still pending. The court also ordered B/T to stop loaning out Tether's stablecoins and to provide a full accounting of the Tether reserve. You can read more about it [here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-judge-orders-tether-to-document-usdt-backing).\n\n\n### Good and Bad News\n\nDespite the controversies surrounding Tether Limited and Bitfinex, USDT has become one of the most widely used stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market. It is accepted on a wide range of exchanges and is often used as a \"bridge currency\" to facilitate trades between different cryptocurrencies. This widespread adoption has helped to make USDT a key player in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\nHowever, the lack of transparency and audits has also led to concerns about the stability of USDT and the potential for fraud or mismanagement. Until Tether Limited undergoes a full audit and proves that it has the necessary reserves to back all of the USDT in circulation, these concerns are likely to continue.\n\n\n### References\n\n\n  - `https://tether.to/en/`\n  - `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)`\n"
