  content: Pick the correct options about FRAX.
  hint: FRAX is not centralized.
  explanation: >-
    The Frax protocol is a decentralized stablecoin that utilizes a novel
    mechanism to maintain price stability. It is open-source and permissionless
    and is currently implemented on Ethereum and 12 other chains.

    What is the difference between the minting process in the 100% collateral
    phase and the fractional phase of the FRAX protocol?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    Anyone can mint new tokens by depositing $1 worth of value into the system.
    The value can be in the form of either FXS or collateral. When FRAX is in
    the 100% collateral phase, all of the value that is used to mint new tokens
    must be in collateral. As the protocol transition into the fractional state,
    some of the value that enters into the system during minting becomes FXS
    (which is then burned).

  hint: NoHint

    The veFXS feature allows FXS holders to lock up their tokens for a certain

    governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller)
    profits. The longer the FXS tokens are locked, the more bonuses awarded to
    the veFXS holders. Additionally, veFXS holders are able to participate in
    Frax gauges and influence or direct FXS to different FRAX gauges, a similar
    mechanism established by the Curve protocol and its gauge system.

    How does the Frax Protocol handle situations where additional collateral is
    needed?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    The Frax Protocol has built-in mechanisms, known as recollateralization and
    buybacks, to handle situations where additional collateral is needed or
    excess collateral is present. When the total collateral value in USD falls
    below the desired collateral ratio, recollateralization allows users to add
    collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%.
    This incentivizes arbitragers to close the gap and restore the collateral
    ratio for FRAX.

    How does the Frax Protocol handle situations when there is more collateral
    than needed to maintain the collateral ratio?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    Buybacks occur when there is more collateral than needed to maintain the
    collateral ratio. In this case, FXS holders can use FXS tokens to "buy back"
    the excess collateral, which is then burned by the platform. This converts
    the excess value into FXS tokens, maintaining the target collateral ratio.
    However, it's important to note that there is no bonus rate for the buyback
    function.
