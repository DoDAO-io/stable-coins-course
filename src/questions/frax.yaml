    What is the difference between the minting process in the 100% collateral
    phase and the fractional phase of the FRAX protocol?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    Anyone can mint new tokens by depositing $1 worth of value into the system.
    The value can be in the form of either FXS or collateral. When FRAX is in
    the 100% collateral phase, all of the value that is used to mint new tokens
    must be in collateral. As the protocol transition into the fractional state,
    some of the value that enters into the system during minting becomes FXS
    (which is then burned).

  content: How does the collateral ratio refresh function adjust the collateral ratio?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    The collateral ratio refresh function in the protocol can be called by any
    user once per hour. If the price of FRAX is above or below $1, the function
    can change the collateral ratio in steps of .25%. When FRAX is above $1, the
    function lowers the collateral ratio by one step and when the price of FRAX
    is below $1, the function increases the collateral ratio by one step.

    How does the FRAX protocol create arbitrage opportunities when the price
    moves below $1?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    If the market price of FRAX falls below $1, FRAX tokens can be bought
    cheaply on the open market and redeemed for $1 of value from the system.
    This creates an arbitrage opportunity. At all times, users are able to
    redeem FRAX for $1 worth of value from the system. The only difference is
    what proportion of the collateral and FXS is returned to the redeemer.

  content: Pick the correct statement. Assume that the collateral ratio is 97%.
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    Anyone can mint new tokens by depositing $1 worth of value into the system.
    The value can be in the form of either FXS or collateral. When FRAX is in
    the 100% collateral phase, all of the value that is used to mint new tokens
    must be in collateral. As the protocol transition into the fractional state,
    some of the value that enters into the system during minting becomes FXS
    (which is then burned). For example, in a 96% collateral ratio, every FRAX
    minted requires $.96 of collateral and burning $.04 worth of FXS. Thus, In a
    97% collateral ratio, every FRAX minted requires $.97 of collateral and
    burning $.03 of FXS, and so on.

  content: Pick the correct statement. Assume that the collateral ratio is 98%.
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    As the protocol moves into the fractional phase, part of the value that
    leaves the system during redemption becomes FXS (which is minted to give to
    the redeeming user). For example, in a 98% collateral ratio, every FRAX can
    be redeemed for $.98 of collateral and $.02 of minted FXS. In a 97%
    collateral ratio, every FRAX can be redeemed for $.97 of collateral and $.03
    of minted FXS.
