  content: What was the main focus of the security audit of the Dai Token (DAI) smart contract?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: In 2019, Callisto Network Security conducted a security audit of the Dai Token (DAI) smart contract which identified four issues, including three of low severity and one of owner privileges (which could potentially be risky for investors). No critical security issues were discovered. The audit specifically identified known vulnerabilities of ERC-20 tokens, the ability for the contract owner to block transferring, a missing event in ERC20 compliance, and the need to check input addresses for empty values. Overall, the audited smart contract was determined to be safe to deploy, with only low severity issues found during the audit.
