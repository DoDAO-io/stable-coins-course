    USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US
    dollar. It was created in 2018 by Circle and Coinbase through a partnership
    called the CENTRE consortium. USDC is an ERC-20 token, which means it is
    built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows a set of standardized
    protocols. It allows users to send US dollars over the internet and on
    public blockchains, giving them greater accessibility and faster transfer
    speeds. In addition, USDC can be easily converted back to US dollars at any
    time.



    Circle is a Boston-based financial services company that was founded in
    2013. It offers a variety of products and services, including a peer-to-peer
    payment platform, a cryptocurrency exchange, and a trading platform for
    institutional investors. In addition to creating USDC, Circle has also
    played a significant role in the development of the stablecoin market.



    Coinbase is a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange that was founded
    in 2012. It is one of the largest and most well-known exchanges in the
    world, and it offers a range of products and services for both individual
    and institutional investors.



    USDC was developed to address two main issues with other cryptocurrencies:
    volatility and the difficulty of converting between fiat currencies and
    cryptocurrencies. To maintain stability and transparency, USDC is fully
    backed by US dollars held in reserve, and the CENTRE consortium publishes
    regular reports on the total supply of USDC and the amount of backing it
    has. In addition, members of the consortium must meet certain standards,
    including licensing, compliance, technology, and accounting, in order to
    issue USDC.

    ### Mint and Burn



    Businesses can open a Circle Account to trade US dollars for USDC. When a
    company deposits USD into their Circle Account, Circle credits the company
    with the corresponding amount of USDC. "Minting" is the process of creating
    a new USDC. This operation generates new USDC for circulation.



    Similarly, if a company wants to trade its USDC for US dollars, they can
    deposit USDC into their Circle Account and request to receive US dollars for
    free. "Burning" is the process of redeeming USDC. This procedure removes
    USDC from circulation.



    When US dollars are exchanged for USDC on a digital asset exchange, the
    exchange will normally supply the balance of USDC on hand to complete the
    trade. If the exchange needs additional USDC to complete the deal, it will
    frequently use its Circle Account to create extra USDC.



    ### Transparency



    Since its launch in 2018, Circle has published monthly reserve reports for
    USDC that are attested to by Grant Thornton, a global accounting firm. These
    reports provide independent confirmation that Circle holds at least as much
    in dollar-denominated reserves as the amount of USDC in circulation. In
    addition to the standard information provided in these reports, Circle also
    recently began publishing details about the CUSIPs, maturity dates, and
    market values of the T-bills in its portfolio, as well as the financial
    institutions that hold the cash portion of the USDC reserve and the weighted
    average maturity of the entire reserve. Starting in July 2022, Grant
    Thornton's attestations will cover all of this additional information,
    providing independent confirmation of the detailed composition and
    sufficiency of the USDC reserve. An attestation from an accounting firm is
    similar to an audit in that it provides assurance around specific statements
    or criteria. In this case, the firm reviews the supporting documentation
    prepared by Circle's management and verifies the criteria presented in the
    reserve report. Circle also files annual audited financial statements with
    the SEC that cover the USDC reserve. In order to prepare the reserve report,
    Circle must reconcile the differences between the real-time movement of USDC
    on the blockchain and the settlement delays and business hours of
    traditional financial institutions. These differences are accounted for in
    the attested reserve asset balances and do not impact the overall size of
    the reserve or the fact that USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars.
    Circle's commitment to providing transparent and timely reporting on its
    risk minimization and liquidity maintenance efforts helps to give the market
    confidence in USDC. It plans to continue enhancing its transparency as
    policy and regulatory requirements evolve and better reporting opportunities
    arise.



    ### Backing



    USDC is fully backed by the equivalent value of U.S. dollar-denominated
    assets and is held in the management and custody of leading U.S. financial
    institutions, including BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon. The USDC
    reserve consists of cash and short-dated U.S. government obligations,
    specifically U.S. Treasuries with maturities of three months or less. As of
    May 13, 2022, the USDC reserve was worth $50.6 billion and consisted of
    $11.6 billion in cash (22.9%) and $39.0 billion in U.S. Treasuries (77.1%).
    As of Jan 5, 2023 the total USDC in circulation is $44 B. The total
    circulating supply is also equal to $44 billion.



    USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. Customers of Circle can mint
    or redeem USDC in exchange for U.S. dollars through their Circle account,
    with the exchange happening nearly instantly subject to the settlement of
    funds. Individual retail users can also exchange USDC for U.S. dollars
    globally through leading digital asset exchanges such as Binance and
    Coinbase. As of May 13, 2022, Circle had minted 99.3 billion USDC and
    redeemed 61.1 billion USDC during the year. There are thousands of projects
    and exchanges supporting USDC in over 190 countries, facilitating its use
    and exchange for market participants. On Jan 5, 2023, the 24-hour trading
    volume of USDC was $ 4 billion.
