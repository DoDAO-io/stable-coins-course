    USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US
    dollar. It was created in 2018 by Circle and Coinbase through a partnership
    called the CENTRE consortium. USDC is an ERC-20 token, which means it is
    built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows a set of standardized
    protocols. It allows users to send US dollars over the internet and on
    public blockchains, giving them greater accessibility and faster transfer
    speeds. In addition, USDC can be easily converted back to US dollars at any
    time.



    Circle is a Boston-based financial services company that was founded in
    2013. It offers a variety of products and services, including a peer-to-peer
    payment platform, a cryptocurrency exchange, and a trading platform for
    institutional investors. In addition to creating USDC, Circle has also
    played a significant role in the development of the stablecoin market.



    Coinbase is a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange that was founded
    in 2012. It is one of the largest and most well-known exchanges in the
    world, and it offers a range of products and services for both individual
    and institutional investors.



    USDC was developed to address two main issues with other cryptocurrencies:
    volatility and the difficulty of converting between fiat currencies and
    cryptocurrencies. To maintain stability and transparency, USDC is fully
    backed by US dollars held in reserve, and the CENTRE consortium publishes
    regular reports on the total supply of USDC and the amount of backing it
    has. In addition, members of the consortium must meet certain standards,
    including licensing, compliance, technology, and accounting, in order to
    issue USDC.
