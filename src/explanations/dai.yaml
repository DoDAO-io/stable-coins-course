    ### About


    DAI is a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a value of one US dollar. It was created by the MakerDAO project, which was launched in 2017 by Rune Christensen, the CEO of MakerDAO. MakerDAO is an open-source project that is maintained by a team of developers and a community of volunteers.


    DAI is unique in that it is a decentralized stablecoin, which means that it is not issued or controlled by any central authority. Instead, it is generated and managed by a network of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized nature of DAI allows it to be free from the influence of governments or financial institutions and makes it more resistant to censorship or interference.


    DAI is used in various ways, including as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a collateral asset. It has gained widespread adoption in the cryptocurrency community and has been used in a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.


    ### Minting and Burning DAI


    Dai is generated when users deposit collateral assets into [Maker Vaults](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#maker-vaults) (Maker Vaults facilitate the generation of Dai against locked-up collateral. Users open Vaults via the Oasis Borrow dashboard or one of many other user interfaces that allow the management of Vault operations ) within the Maker Protocol. This process allows users to access liquidity and enters Dai into circulation. Others can obtain Dai by purchasing it from brokers or exchanges, or by receiving it as payment.


    Once generated, purchased, or received, Dai can be used in the same way as other cryptocurrencies. It can be sent to others, used as payment for goods and services, and even saved through a feature of the Maker Protocol called the [Dai Savings Rate (DSR)](https://ethereumprice.org/guides/article/dai-savings-rate-explained/).


    If a user who has borrowed DAI against collateral decides to pay back the loan, the DAI coins are "burned" and the collateral deposit in the account is available for withdrawal. The process of minting and burning DAI helps to maintain its value at or near one US dollar.


    The MCD_DAI_JOIN adapter contract in the Maker Protocol is authorized to call the mint and burn functions of the DAI token in order to increase or decrease the total supply of DAI. These functions are also used when users deposit or withdraw DAI from the Dai Savings Rate contract.


    ### Transparency and Audits


    MakerDAO and the DAI stablecoin are designed to be transparent and auditable. The smart contracts that govern the Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) and the minting and burning of DAI are open-source, which allows anyone to review the code and understand how the system works.


    In addition, MakerDAO has undergone several independent audits by reputable firms, which have found that the system is secure and functioning as intended. In 2019, Callisto Network Security conducted a security audit of the Dai Token (DAI) smart contract which identified four issues, including three of low severity and one of owner privileges (which could potentially be risky for investors). No critical security issues were discovered. The audit specifically identified known vulnerabilities of ERC-20 tokens, the ability for the contract owner to block transferring, a missing event in ERC20 compliance, and the need to check input addresses for empty values. Overall, the audited smart contract was determined to be safe to deploy, with only low severity issues found during the audit.

    ### Backing of DAI


    All DAI is backed by surplus collateral that has been escrowed in audited and publicly viewable Ethereum smart contracts. This means that anyone with an internet connection can monitor the health of the system at any time by visiting [daistats.com](https://daistats.com/).


    The value of the collateral used to mint DAI must always exceed the value of the DAI itself, a process known as overcollaterization. This is to ensure that the collateral can cover the value of the DAI in the event that the market value of the collateral falls. If the value of the collateral falls below the value of the DAI, the vault account may be liquidated, with a ratio of 1.5 collateral to 1 DAI.


    To ensure that undercollateralized accounts have sufficient funds to be liquidated, the MakerDAO system offers "keeper" accounts. Keepers are special user accounts that stake their cryptocurrency holdings to provide liquidity to pay off the collateral of vault accounts that lose value over time. This helps to maintain a steady supply of DAI in circulation to match the value of one US dollar.


    ### Issues and Hacks


    Like any complex system, MakerDAO and DAI have experienced some issues and challenges. In 2020, the value of Ethereum plummeted, which caused many CDPs to be liquidated and resulted in a significant amount of DAI being minted. This led to a temporary increase in the supply of DAI, which caused its value to drop below one US dollar.


    There have also been instances of hacks and vulnerabilities in the system, but these have been addressed and fixed by the MakerDAO team.


    ### Good and Bad News


    DAI has generally been well-received and has gained widespread adoption as a stablecoin. It has been used in various applications, including as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a collateral asset.


    However, there are also some concerns about the backing of DAI and the potential for market manipulation. Some critics have argued that the reliance on Ethereum as collateral makes DAI vulnerable to fluctuations in the value of Ethereum.


    [Recently](https://cointelegraph.com/news/makerdao-should-seriously-consider-depegging-dai-from-usd-founder), MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen has suggested that the organization should "seriously consider" depegging its stablecoin, DAI, from the US dollar following recent sanctions on cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash and the freezing of USDC addresses by Circle. Christensen raised concerns over DAI's heavy reliance on a centralized asset, USDC, which represents over 50% of MakerDAO's DAI collateralization, according to Dai Stats. The stablecoin is currently the fourth largest USD-pegged stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with a market cap of $7 billion. The idea of converting all USDC from MakerDAO's peg stability module into ether was met with criticism, with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calling it a "risky and terrible idea."


    Despite these concerns, DAI has proven to be a reliable and stable stablecoin, and its use is likely to continue to grow in the future.
