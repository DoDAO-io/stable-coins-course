    ## What are Stablecoins

    Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are pegged to the value of a
    fiat currency, commodity, or other cryptocurrency. The value of a stablecoin
    is designed to remain stable, unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
    which can experience significant price fluctuations. Examples of stablecoins
    include Tether, USD Coin, Dai etc. These coins can be used for various
    applications such as trading, payments and remittances.


    ## Why Stablecoins?

    One of the most promising benefits of blockchain technology is its ability
    to provide a global financial  system that can settle payments within
    seconds. A strong and stable global currency is an essential part  of a
    healthy financial system, and over the past few years we've seen many
    innovative projects come up with  ideas for creating tokens that are
    equivalent to USD or other currencies on the blockchain. Some of these
    projects  have failed, but a few have survived and proven to be very
    resilient.



    There are a few key reasons why stablecoins are seen as a useful tool:

    - **Improving cross-border transactions**: Stablecoins can help facilitate
    low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border transactions while reducing
    complexity compared to traditional methods.

    - **Entry Point**: Newcomers to the crypto world often want a stable way to
    store their money, similar to what  they're used to with banks. Stablecoins
    offer a more predictable and stable path for these people.

    - **Base Currency** : A stablecoins value does not fluctuate as much as
    other cryptocurrencies, making it a more reliable currency to calculate
    stocks, transactions, and spends with. This also makes it easier to compare
    the value of one thing to another.

    - **Increased adoption** : The volatility of other cryptocurrencies can make
    them difficult to use for everyday transactions or as a means of payment.
    Stablecoins can make it easier for businesses and individuals to use and
    accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which leads to an increase in
    adoption.

    - **Better risk management** : Stablecoins can provide an alternative to
    traditional investments  and can be used to hedge against market volatility.

    - **Decentralized Finance**: Stablecoins can be used as collateral,
    borrowing and lending in decentralized  finance platforms which can provide
    more opportunities for financial inclusion and better returns compared  to
    traditional finance.

    ## Types of Stablecoins

    In the last few years, many stablecoin projects have been created, each with
    a different approach to representing the USD on blockchain. Let's first look
    at the most prominent categories of stablecoins and then understand the
    advantages and drawbacks of each of these categories.


    ### Fiat Backed

    Fiat-backed stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the
    US dollar. In this system, each USD-pegged token is backed 1:1 by actual US
    dollars. This means that fiat-backed stablecoins must be backed by bank
    accounts that contain USD or other stable currency. As a result, the old
    financial system's centralized structure and regulated institutions are used
    by fiat-backed stablecoin issuers.


    Since there are no clear regulations governing the production of
    stablecoins, financial institutions have no specific standards to follow.
    This lack of transparency can be a major problem for stablecoin issuers, as
    it leaves them open to exploitative practices.


    Stablecoin issuers earn revenue from investing the cash they receive from
    customers, and use this money to cover their operational expenses. Any money
    left over after paying for operations is generally profit for the issuer.
    However, in some cases issuers may choose to invest this money in long-term
    or risky ventures in order to maximize their profits. This can lead to
    losses of funds for customers.


    **It's important for users to understand how stablecoins are backed. What
    percentage of the backing is in cash, and what percentage is in investments?
    What types of investments are made by the issuer?**


    ### Crypto Backed

    Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are a type of digital asset that is backed
    by other digital assets like BTC, ETH, or other tokens. In order to mint new
    stablecoins, digital assets are locked up as collateral in smart contracts.
    DAI from MakerDAO is a well-known example of a stablecoin that is backed by
    cryptocurrency.


    Since crypto prices can be volatile, stablecoins are overcollateralized to
    ensure that the price stays as stable as possible. This means that a
    stablecoin with a crypto asset backing of $1 might have an underlying asset
    worth at least $2. If crypto prices fall, more crypto must be used to back
    the stablecoin; otherwise, the stablecoins' value would decrease.


    There can still be cases where the value of crypto falls and the collateral
    value becomes lower than the optimal ratio. In these cases, platforms
    liquidate the position of the borrower (the person who deposits collateral
    to mint new stablecoins). Different platforms take different approaches to
    liquidation, some selling the collateral at a fixed discount, and some using
    American or Dutch options. The amount of collateral to be liquidated also
    varies from one platform to another.


    ### Commodity Backed

    Commodity-backed stablecoins are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins in that
    they are backed by physical commodities such as gold, silver, or oil. Even
    real estate can be used as collateral for commodity-backed stablecoins. The
    coins may or may not be redeemable for the physical asset. In a sense,
    commodity-backed stablecoins are a digital representation of a valuable
    real-world asset.


    For those who find it difficult to invest in literal precious commodities,
    commodity-backed stablecoins can be a useful alternative. These coins are
    backed by commodities like gold, which gives them the same value as the
    collateral. They can be liquidated when desired, and because they're not as
    volatile as fiat or cryptocurrencies, they can be a safer investment.


    ### Algorithmic

    The "two-coin" system is a typical algorithmic stablecoin structure in which
    one coin is used to "absorb" market volatility, and the other strives to
    keep the peg. 


    Lets assume there are two tokens `A_USD`, and `ALGO`. `A_USD` value remains
    $1 and `ALGO` is balancer token which is sold or bought to maintain the peg
    of  `A_USD` at $1


    When the `A_USD` supply is too small and demand for it is too high, the
    price of `A_USD` goes above $1. To bring `A_USD` back to its peg, the
    protocol lets users trade 1 `A_USD` of `ALGO` for 1 `A_USD`. This trade
    burns 1 USD of `ALGO` and mints 1 `A_USD`, which users can sell for 1.01 USD
    and pocket a profit of 1 cent. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but these
    profits add up when done in large quantities.


    When the supply is too large and demand is too low, the opposite happens:
    The price of `A_USD` goes below $1. So the protocol lets users do the
    opposite as above: Users can buy 1 `A_USD` for 0.99 USD, then trade 1
    `A_USD` for 1 USD of `ALGO`. The trade burns 1 `A_USD` and mints 1 USD of
    `ALGO`, netting the arbitrage trader a profit of .01 `A_USD`.


    This is how the price of `A_USD` is maintained at $1 USD

    A stablecoin must maintain a delicate balance between three major
    objectives: price stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency. 



    **Price Stability** - Price stability is one of the most important aspects
    for stablecoins. Fiat-based coins offer the highest price stability,
    followed by crypto-backed coins and then algorithmic stablecoins. In 2022,
    we saw the failure of the biggest algorithmic coin, UST.


    **Importance of Decentralization** - Decentralization is important because
    it allows for more democratic practices around the world. When governments
    have too much control, they can block users' funds which can cripple a
    person's ability to speak out or protest against the government. A fully
    decentralized world would benefit greatly from these democratic practices,
    and we should strive to not give up on these principles. Even though fiat
    backed stable coins have excellent price stability, they lack
    decentralization as they are issued by a centralized issuer.


    **Capital Efficiency** -  Capital efficiency defined as how much capital is
    required to make $1 of a token. In case of algorithmic coins we might not
    need any real assets, so it has very high capital efficiency. In case of
    fiat backed stable coins we need 1 USD cash(something similar) to create $1
    token.  In case of collateralized crypto coins, this value can be as high as
    3-4 times i.e. we might need $3-$4 worth of crypto assets as collateral to
    generate $1 worth of stablecoin token.

    At the end of 2022, transactions that only involve the top four largest
    stablecoins by market capitalization (USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI) make up 76%
    of all trading volume across centralized exchanges, according to
    CryptoCompare. Fiat-backed stablecoins make up 91.7% of this crypto sector,
    and Tether (USDT) and USDCoin (USDC) comprise the majority of that, leaving
    crypto-backed and algorithmic stablecoins to make up the remainder.


    Stablecoins have a lot of potential uses that could be really beneficial for
    mainstream commercial purposes, like merchant payments and cross-border
    remittances. In fact, we're starting to see more stablecoin payments being
    sent all over the world via public blockchain networks - which suggests that
    these assets are not just a store of value for crypto market players, but
    actually represent an improvement over traditional payment methods. So it's
    likely that demand for stablecoins will continue to grow in the long term. 


    That's one of the reasons why we're seeing more DeFi protocols launching
    their own platform-native stablecoins - as a way to source liquidity and
    offer integrated services.


    For example, the team behind automated market maker Curve has released plans
    on Github for a new stablecoin design called a Lending-Liquidating AMM
    Algorithm or LLAMMA. With this design, the collateral type is contingent on
    price performance. Decentralized lender Aave has also released a technical
    paper for its upcoming overcollateralized GHO stablecoin. This could help it
    lower capital efficiency costs.
