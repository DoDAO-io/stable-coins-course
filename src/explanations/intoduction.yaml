    One of the most promising benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to provide a global financial 
    system that can settle payments within seconds. A strong and stable global currency is an essential part 
    of a healthy financial system, and over the past few years we've seen many innovative projects come up with 
    ideas for creating tokens that are equivalent to USD or other currencies on the blockchain. Some of these projects 
    have failed, but a few have survived and proven to be very resilient.
    
    
    Stablecoins are seen as a useful tool for a number of reasons:
    - **Improving cross-border transactions** : Stablecoins can facilitate low-cost, fast and cross-border 
    transactions with high security and reduced complexity compared to traditional methods.
  
    - **Entry Point** : New comers to crypto want a stable way of storing their money just like they do with banks.
     Stablecoins offer a more stable and predicable path to the new comers.  
    
    - **Base Currency** : We are all used to calculating all the stocks, transactions, spends in a base currency
    that remains pretty stable with time and makes it easier to compare value of one thing with another.

    - **Increased adoption** : The volatility of other cryptocurrencies can make them difficult to use for 
    everyday transactions or as a means of payment. Stablecoins can make it easier for businesses and 
    individuals to use and accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

    - **Better risk management** : Stablecoins can provide an alternative to traditional investments 
    and can be used to hedge against market volatility.
    
    
    - **Decentralized Finance**: Stablecoins can be used as collateral, borrowing and lending in decentralized 
    finance platforms which can provide more opportunities for financial inclusion and better returns compared 
    to traditional finance.
