    One of the most promising benefits of blockchain technology is its ability
    to provide a global financial  system that can settle payments within
    seconds. A strong and stable global currency is an essential part  of a
    healthy financial system, and over the past few years we've seen many
    innovative projects come up with  ideas for creating tokens that are
    equivalent to USD or other currencies on the blockchain. Some of these
    projects  have failed, but a few have survived and proven to be very
    resilient.


    Stablecoins are seen as a useful tool for a number of reasons: - 

    - **Improving cross-border transactions** : Stablecoins can facilitate
    low-cost, fast and cross-border  transactions with high security and reduced
    complexity compared to traditional methods.

    - **Entry Point** : New comers to crypto want a stable way of storing their
    money just like they do with banks.
     Stablecoins offer a more stable and predicable path to the new comers.  

    - **Base Currency** : We are all used to calculating all the stocks,
    transactions, spends in a base currency that remains pretty stable with time
    and makes it easier to compare value of one thing with another.

    - **Increased adoption** : The volatility of other cryptocurrencies can make
    them difficult to use for  everyday transactions or as a means of payment.
    Stablecoins can make it easier for businesses and  individuals to use and
    accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

    - **Better risk management** : Stablecoins can provide an alternative to
    traditional investments  and can be used to hedge against market volatility.


    - **Decentralized Finance**: Stablecoins can be used as collateral,
    borrowing and lending in decentralized  finance platforms which can provide
    more opportunities for financial inclusion and better returns compared  to
    traditional finance.
