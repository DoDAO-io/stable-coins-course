    ## What are Stablecoins

    Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are pegged to the value of a
    fiat currency, commodity, or other cryptocurrency. The value of a stablecoin
    is designed to remain stable, unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
    which can experience significant price fluctuations. Examples of stablecoins
    include Tether, USD Coin, Dai etc. These coins can be used for various
    applications such as trading, payments and remittances.


    ## Why Stablecoins?

    One of the most promising benefits of blockchain technology is its ability
    to provide a global financial  system that can settle payments within
    seconds. A strong and stable global currency is an essential part  of a
    healthy financial system, and over the past few years we've seen many
    innovative projects come up with  ideas for creating tokens that are
    equivalent to USD or other currencies on the blockchain. Some of these
    projects  have failed, but a few have survived and proven to be very
    resilient.



    There are a few key reasons why stablecoins are seen as a useful tool:

    - **Improving cross-border transactions**: Stablecoins can help facilitate
    low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border transactions while reducing
    complexity compared to traditional methods.

    - **Entry Point**: Newcomers to the crypto world often want a stable way to
    store their money, similar to what  they're used to with banks. Stablecoins
    offer a more predictable and stable path for these people.

    - **Base Currency** : A stablecoins value does not fluctuate as much as
    other cryptocurrencies, making it a more reliable currency to calculate
    stocks, transactions, and spends with. This also makes it easier to compare
    the value of one thing to another.

    - **Increased adoption** : The volatility of other cryptocurrencies can make
    them difficult to use for everyday transactions or as a means of payment.
    Stablecoins can make it easier for businesses and individuals to use and
    accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which leads to an increase in
    adoption.

    - **Better risk management** : Stablecoins can provide an alternative to
    traditional investments  and can be used to hedge against market volatility.

    - **Decentralized Finance**: Stablecoins can be used as collateral,
    borrowing and lending in decentralized  finance platforms which can provide
    more opportunities for financial inclusion and better returns compared  to
    traditional finance.
