    ### Introduction


    The [Frax protocol](https://frax.finance/) is a decentralized stablecoin
    that utilizes a novel mechanism to maintain price stability. It is
    open-source and permissionless and is currently implemented on Ethereum and
    12 other chains. Frax was founded by Sam Hamidi-Kazemian, Travis Moore, and
    Jason Huan. It was announced in May 2019 as a Decentral bank and was
    launched on the Ethereum Mainnet in December 2020. The goal of the Frax
    protocol is to provide a highly scalable and decentralized form of
    algorithmic money, as an alternative to fixed-supply digital assets like
    Bitcoin.



    The Frax ecosystem includes two stablecoins, FRAX and FPI, which are pegged
    to the US dollar and the US Consumer Price Index respectively. It also
    includes Fraxswap, a native automated market maker, and Fraxlend, a
    permissionless lending facility.



    Frax is unique in that it is a fractional stablecoin, meaning that parts of
    its supply are backed by collateral and parts are algorithmically
    stabilized. Fraxswap is the first AMM to use time-weighted average market
    maker orders, which the Frax protocol uses for rebalancing collateral,
    minting and redeeming tokens, expanding and contracting FRAX supply, and
    deploying protocol-owned liquidity on-chain. Fraxlend allows for debt
    origination, customized non-custodial loans, and onboarding of collateral
    assets to the Frax Finance economy.



    Frax's end goal is to build important decentralized stablecoins in the
    world, such as the Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin, which is pegged to a
    basket of consumer goods, creating its own unit of account separate from any
    nation-state denominated money. The Frax ecosystem includes four tokens:
    FRAX, the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin; Frax Share
    (FXS), the governance token of the entire Frax ecosystem which accrues fees,
    seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value; FPI, the
    inflation-resistant, CPI-pegged stablecoin; and FPIS, the governance token
    of the Frax Price Index.



    The Frax ecosystem also includes a Gauge Rewards System, where the community
    can propose new gauge rewards for strategies that integrate FRAX
    stablecoins. FXS emissions are fixed, halve each year, and entirely flow to
    different gauges based on the votes of FXS stakers.


    ### Mint and Redeem

    The Frax Protocol's minting and redeeming system plays a crucial role in
    maintaining the stability of FRAX tokens. Users can mint FRAX by providing
    both collateral tokens (such as USDC) and governance tokens (FXS). The
    proportion of each token required is determined by the Frax [collateral
    ratio](https://docs.frax.finance/price-stability#collateral-ratio) (CR). For
    example, if the CR is 50%, a user can mint one dollar worth of FRAX by
    providing $0.50 worth of USDC and $0.50 worth of FXS. The same process
    reverses when a user chooses to redeem their FRAX for USDC and FXS.



    When new FRAX tokens are minted, FXS is burned in proportion to the
    uncollateralized amount. With a collateralization ratio of 50%, for every
    FRAX token minted, $0.50 worth of FXS is burned. This decreases the
    circulating supply of FXS and creates buy pressure for the token.
    Conversely, when the protocol increases the collateralization ratio, more
    FXS is minted and distributed, increasing the supply and exerting downward
    pressure on the price. As usage and adoption of FRAX increases, more FRAX
    tokens are minted than redeemed, resulting in a large amount of FXS being
    burned and removed from circulation. This creates a resilient tokenomic
    model for FXS that helps ensure price stability for FRAX.



    All FRAX tokens are fungible with one another and entitled to the same
    proportion of collateral no matter what collateral ratio they were minted
    at. This system of equations describes the minting function of the Frax
    Protocol:

    Redeeming FRAX is done by rearranging the previous system of equations for
    simplicity, and solving for the units of collateral, Y, and the units of
    FXS, Z.

    ### Recollateralization and Buybacks



    The Frax Protocol has built-in mechanisms, known as recollateralization and
    buybacks, to handle situations where additional collateral is needed or
    excess collateral is present. When the total collateral value in USD falls
    below the desired collateral ratio, recollateralization allows users to add
    collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%.
    This incentivizes arbitragers to close the gap and restore the collateral
    ratio for FRAX. On the other hand, buybacks occur when there is more
    collateral than needed to maintain the collateral ratio. In this case, FXS
    holders can use FXS tokens to "buy back" the excess collateral, which is
    then burned by the platform. This converts the excess value into FXS tokens,
    maintaining the target collateral ratio. However, it's important to note
    that there is no bonus rate for the buyback function.



    ### Transparency and Audits



    FRAX is committed to transparency and has undergone several independent
    audits to ensure the security and stability of its platform. The team
    regularly publishes audit reports and technical details about the platform's
    underlying smart contracts on its GitHub page, allowing users and
    researchers to review and verify the platform's code.
    [Here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits) is the complete list of
    audits.



    ### Performance Upgrades: veFXS and FRAX v2 AMOs



    The Frax protocol has introduced several performance upgrades to its system,
    including the veFXS and Frax v2 AMOs. The veFXS feature allows FXS holders
    to lock up their tokens for a certain period of time in order to generate
    voting escrow FXS and earn bonuses, governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic
    Market Operations Controller) profits. The longer the FXS tokens are locked,
    the more bonuses awarded to the veFXS holders. Additionally, veFXS holders
    are able to participate in Frax gauges and influence or direct FXS to
    different FRAX gauges, a similar mechanism established by the Curve protocol
    and its gauge system.



    Recently, [Convex has partnered with the Frax
    protocol](https://convexfinance.medium.com/december-update-protocol-expansion-cvx-eth-incentive-migration-2c9327b48259#0a3b)
    to further align the two protocols' incentive programs, specifically around
    locking veFXS into the CVX protocol. Convex was launched in [May
    2021](https://convexfinance.medium.com/convex-finance-pre-launch-announcement-3630b2a428d0)
    as a platform intended to boost CRV rewards and simplify staking CRV for
    liquidity providers and stakers by creating an access point to CRV benefits
    through its native CVX token. As a result, Convex began actively collecting
    CRV and veCRV tokens as soon as it was introduced. By early summer 2021, it
    had become the largest holder of veCRV tokens in the [Curve
    Wars](https://medium.com/bityard/the-curve-wars-explained-2c4e9594617).
    Curve Finance compensates liquidity providers with CRV tokens, granting
    governance rights over which protocols' pools are supported through CRV
    awards and fee sharing.Thus, Frax holds [≈21%](https://daocvx.com/) of CVX
    giving them substantial governance power in the Convex protocol, which can
    be thought of as a proxy for veCRV governance power and directing future CRV
    rewards.



    Furthermore, Frax has launched the algorithmic market operations modules, or
    AMOs, which creates smoother operations for Frax by automating the movement
    of FRAX and its collateral across the DeFi ecosystem. The Frax AMOs further
    enable FRAX growth by leveraging Frax’s assets in a capital efficient way.



    ### Growth and Adoption



    One piece of good news for FRAX is the platform's growing user base and
    trading volume, which have steadily increased since its launch. The market
    cap reached $130M within a month of launch, and later on reached its peak at
    $2.9B. As of 14th Jan, 2023 the market cap is at $1.02B. FRAX has also
    received positive attention from the DeFi community and has partnered with
    several well-known projects in the space, including Chainlink and Compound.



    The Frax protocol offers a new and improved solution for stablecoins by
    utilizing Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology. By combining the use of
    FRAX stablecoins and FXS governance tokens, the protocol ensures trustless
    stability, decentralization and scalability in the face of market
    instability. Unlike other stablecoins such as Tether or DAI, FRAX eliminates
    the risk of over-collateralization and sudden market fluctuations.



    As the market adapts to the growing demands and challenges, the adoption of
    crypto and stablecoins continues to rise. Among the latest innovations in
    the crypto space, FRAX is leading the way with its unique
    fractional-algorithmic approach to stability. To learn more about FRAX and
    its approach, visit their [website](https://frax.finance/) as well as

    The price stability of stable coins is an important factor to consider, as
    we have seen that many algorithmic coins are not able to maintain a stable
    peg and have resulted in failure. The hybrid model of FRAX uses the same
    technique for minting and burning stable coins, but here the collateral is
    also added or redeemed to the system and not just the absorption token
    (FSX).


    At all times in order to mint new FRAX a user must place $1 worth of value
    into the system


    ### When FRAX price moves above $1


    Anyone can mint new tokens by depositing $1 worth of value into the system.
    The value can be in the form of either FXS or collateral. When FRAX is in
    the 100% collateral phase, all of the value that is used to mint new tokens
    must be in collateral. As the protocol transition into the fractional state,
    some of the value that enters into the system during minting becomes FXS
    (which is then burned). For example, in a 96% collateral ratio, every FRAX
    minted requires $.96 of collateral and burning $.04 worth of FXS. In a 95%
    collateral ratio, every FRAX minted requires $.95 of collateral and burning
    $.05 of FXS, and so on.


    If the price of FRAX jumps to 1.01, people who get involved in these
    arbitrage opportunities, can make a profit of 1 cent for every dollar minted


    ### When FRAX price moves blow $1

    If the market price of FRAX falls below $1, FRAX tokens can be bought
    cheaply on the open market and redeemed for $1 of value from the system.
    This creates an arbitrage opportunity. At all times, users are able to
    redeem FRAX for $1 worth of value from the system. The only difference is
    what proportion of the collateral and FXS is returned to the redeemer. When
    FRAX is in the 100% collateral phase, 100% of the value returned from
    redeeming FRAX is collateral.


    As the protocol moves into the fractional phase, part of the value that
    leaves the system during redemption becomes FXS (which is minted to give to
    the redeeming user). For example, in a 98% collateral ratio, every FRAX can
    be redeemed for $.98 of collateral and $.02 of minted FXS. In a 97%
    collateral ratio, every FRAX can be redeemed for $.97 of collateral and $.03
    of minted FXS.
