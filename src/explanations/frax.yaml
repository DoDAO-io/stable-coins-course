    ### Introduction

    Many people are hesitant to adopt purely algorithmic coins because so many
    of them have failed over time. For example, UST was the biggest stable coin
    but it got depegged in 2022 and lost all its value. The main problem with
    algorithmic designs is that they often have a hard time getting started,
    they grow slowly, and they can be very volatile, which makes people lose
    faith in their ability to be stablecoins.


    The Frax protocol is a two-token system comprising a stablecoin, Frax
    (FRAX), and a governance token, Frax Shares (FXS). The protocol also has a
    pool contract which holds USDC collateral. Pools can be added or removed
    with governance. Frax is a hibrid of algorithmic and collateral based
    stablecoins.


    Fractional Reserve Asset Exchange (FRAX) stablecoins can be minted by
    placing the appropriate amount of its constituent parts into the system. At
    genesis, FRAX is 100% collateralized, meaning that minting FRAX only
    requires placing collateral into the minting contract. During the fractional
    phase, minting FRAX requires placing the appropriate ratio of collateral and
    burning the ratio of Frax Shares (FXS).


    The Frax Protocol is designed to accept any type of cryptocurrency as
    collateral, but this implementation will mainly use on-chain stablecoins to
    help reduce volatility. This will make it easier for FRAX to transition to
    more algorithmic ratios smoothly. As the system's velocity increases, it
    will become safer to include volatile cryptocurrency, such as ETH and
    wrapped BTC, into future pools with governance.


    Although there's no predetermined timeframes for how quickly the amount of
    collateralization changes, we believe that as FRAX adoption increases, users
    will be more comfortable with a higher percentage of FRAX supply being
    stabilized algorithmically rather than with collateral. 


    The collateral ratio refresh function in the protocol can be called by any
    user once per hour. If the price of FRAX is above or below $1, the function
    can change the collateral ratio in steps of .25%. When FRAX is above $1, the
    function lowers the collateral ratio by one step and when the price of FRAX
    is below $1, the function increases the collateral ratio by one step. Both
    refresh rate and step parameters can be adjusted through governance.


    ### Recollateralization and Buybacks



    The Frax Protocol has built-in mechanisms, known as recollateralization and
    buybacks, to handle situations where additional collateral is needed or
    excess collateral is present. When the total collateral value in USD falls
    below the desired collateral ratio, recollateralization allows users to add
    collateral in exchange for newly minted FXS tokens at a bonus rate of 0.20%.
    This incentivizes arbitragers to close the gap and restore the collateral
    ratio for FRAX. On the other hand, buybacks occur when there is more
    collateral than needed to maintain the collateral ratio. In this case, FXS
    holders can use FXS tokens to "buy back" the excess collateral, which is
    then burned by the platform. This converts the excess value into FXS tokens,
    maintaining the target collateral ratio. However, it's important to note
    that there is no bonus rate for the buyback function.



    ### Transparency and Audits



    FRAX is committed to transparency and has undergone several independent
    audits to ensure the security and stability of its platform. The team
    regularly publishes audit reports and technical details about the platform's
    underlying smart contracts on its GitHub page, allowing users and
    researchers to review and verify the platform's code.
    [Here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits) is the complete list of
    audits.



    ### Performance Upgrades: veFXS and FRAX v2 AMOs



    The Frax protocol has introduced several performance upgrades to its system,
    including the veFXS and Frax v2 AMOs. The veFXS feature allows FXS holders
    to lock up their tokens for a certain period of time in order to generate
    voting escrow FXS and earn bonuses, governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic
    Market Operations Controller) profits. The longer the FXS tokens are locked,
    the more bonuses awarded to the veFXS holders. Additionally, veFXS holders
    are able to participate in Frax gauges and influence or direct FXS to
    different FRAX gauges, a similar mechanism established by the Curve protocol
    and its gauge system.



    Recently, [Convex has partnered with the Frax
    protocol](https://convexfinance.medium.com/december-update-protocol-expansion-cvx-eth-incentive-migration-2c9327b48259#0a3b)
    to further align the two protocols' incentive programs, specifically around
    locking veFXS into the CVX protocol. Convex was launched in [May
    2021](https://convexfinance.medium.com/convex-finance-pre-launch-announcement-3630b2a428d0)
    as a platform intended to boost CRV rewards and simplify staking CRV for
    liquidity providers and stakers by creating an access point to CRV benefits
    through its native CVX token. As a result, Convex began actively collecting
    CRV and veCRV tokens as soon as it was introduced. By early summer 2021, it
    had become the largest holder of veCRV tokens in the [Curve
    Wars](https://medium.com/bityard/the-curve-wars-explained-2c4e9594617).
    Curve Finance compensates liquidity providers with CRV tokens, granting
    governance rights over which protocols' pools are supported through CRV
    awards and fee sharing.Thus, Frax holds [≈21%](https://daocvx.com/) of CVX
    giving them substantial governance power in the Convex protocol, which can
    be thought of as a proxy for veCRV governance power and directing future CRV
    rewards.



    Furthermore, Frax has launched the algorithmic market operations modules, or
    AMOs, which creates smoother operations for Frax by automating the movement
    of FRAX and its collateral across the DeFi ecosystem. The Frax AMOs further
    enable FRAX growth by leveraging Frax’s assets in a capital efficient way.



    ### Growth and Adoption



    One piece of good news for FRAX is the platform's growing user base and
    trading volume, which have steadily increased since its launch. The market
    cap reached $130M within a month of launch, and later on reached its peak at
    $2.9B. As of 14th Jan, 2023 the market cap is at $1.02B. FRAX has also
    received positive attention from the DeFi community and has partnered with
    several well-known projects in the space, including Chainlink and Compound.



    The Frax protocol offers a new and improved solution for stablecoins by
    utilizing Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology. By combining the use of
    FRAX stablecoins and FXS governance tokens, the protocol ensures trustless
    stability, decentralization and scalability in the face of market
    instability. Unlike other stablecoins such as Tether or DAI, FRAX eliminates
    the risk of over-collateralization and sudden market fluctuations.



    As the market adapts to the growing demands and challenges, the adoption of
    crypto and stablecoins continues to rise. Among the latest innovations in
    the crypto space, FRAX is leading the way with its unique
    fractional-algorithmic approach to stability. To learn more about FRAX and
    its approach, visit their [website](https://frax.finance/) as well as

  title: Algorithmic Market Operations Controller (AMO)
  shortTitle: AMO
  details: >
    The AMO module is an autonomous contract that enacts monetary policy, so
    long as it does not change the FRAX price off its peg. This means that AMO
    controllers can perform open market operations algorithmically, but they
    cannot mint FRAX out of thin air and break the peg. This keeps FRAX’s base
    layer stability mechanism pure.


    In Frax v1, The Frax protocol rebalances its collateral ratio (CR)
    dynamically based on the market price of the FRAX stablecoin. If the price
    of FRAX is above $1, then the CR decreases ("decollateralization"). If the
    price of FRAX is below $1, then the CR increases ("recollateralization").
    The protocol always honors redemptions of FRAX at the $1 peg, but since the
    CR is dynamic, it may need to mint Frax Share tokens (FXS) to cover the
    value of any redemptions that exceed the available collateral. For example,
    at an 85% CR, every redeemed FRAX gives the user $.85 USDC and $.15 of
    minted FXS. It is a trivial implementation detail whether the protocol
    returns to the redeemer $.15 worth of FXS directly or atomically sells the
    FXS for collateral onchain to return the full $1 of value in collateral –
    the economic implementation is the same.    


    Frax2 is a generalization of the previous mechanism to any arbitrarily
    complex market operation. This enables the creation of a Turing-complete
    design space of stability mechanisms. Thus, each AMO can be thought of as a
    central bank money lego. Every AMO has four properties:

    1. Decollateralize - the portion of the strategy which lowers the CR 

    2. Market operations - the portion of the strategy that is run in
    equilibrium and doesn't change the CR

    3. Recollateralize - the portion of the strategy which increases the CR 

    4. FXS1559 - a formalized accounting of the balance sheet of the AMO which
    defines exactly how much FXS can be burned with profits above the target
    CR.

  details: >-
    The price stability of stable coins is an important factor to consider, as
    we have seen that many algorithmic coins are not able to maintain a stable
    peg and have resulted in failure. The hybrid model of FRAX uses the same
    technique for minting and burning stable coins, but here the collateral is
    also added or redeemed to the system and not just the absorption token
    (FSX).


    At all times in order to mint new FRAX a user must place $1 worth of value
    into the system

    ### When FRAX price moves above $1


    Anyone can mint new tokens by depositing $1 worth of value into the system.
    The value can be in the form of either FXS or collateral. When FRAX is in
    the 100% collateral phase, all of the value that is used to mint new tokens
    must be in collateral. As the protocol transition into the fractional state,
    some of the value that enters into the system during minting becomes FXS
    (which is then burned). For example, in a 96% collateral ratio, every FRAX
    minted requires $.96 of collateral and burning $.04 worth of FXS. In a 95%
    collateral ratio, every FRAX minted requires $.95 of collateral and burning
    $.05 of FXS, and so on.


    If the price of FRAX jumps to 1.01, people who get involved in these
    arbitrage opportunities, can make a profit of 1 cent for every dollar minted


    ### When FRAX price moves blow $1

    If the market price of FRAX falls below $1, FRAX tokens can be bought
    cheaply on the open market and redeemed for $1 of value from the system.
    This creates an arbitrage opportunity. At all times, users are able to
    redeem FRAX for $1 worth of value from the system. The only difference is
    what proportion of the collateral and FXS is returned to the redeemer. When
    FRAX is in the 100% collateral phase, 100% of the value returned from
    redeeming FRAX is collateral.


    As the protocol moves into the fractional phase, part of the value that
    leaves the system during redemption becomes FXS (which is minted to give to
    the redeeming user). For example, in a 98% collateral ratio, every FRAX can
    be redeemed for $.98 of collateral and $.02 of minted FXS. In a 97%
    collateral ratio, every FRAX can be redeemed for $.97 of collateral and $.03
    of minted FXS.
